Drop the audio files you want the navbar to use into this folder. Use these exact filenames:

- minecraft_chest_open.mp3
- minecraft_chest_close.mp3

Files placed here will be served at runtime at /audio/<filename>. Use small files (<200KB) for fast load. If you prefer a subfolder, update the paths in `src/components/Navbar.jsx` accordingly.
